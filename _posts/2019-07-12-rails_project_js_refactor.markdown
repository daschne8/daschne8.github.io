The latest project assignment involved rehashing our previous Rails only app to use Javascript.  This involved learning a new programming language (Javascript ) understanding of passing JSON objects, rails api calls instead of just page redirects, AJAX,  and using that aformentioned Javascript to make the project much more dynamic and much less static.

My project was a simple linked grocery list app, and as such I didn't feel it needed the slew of pages it had before.  Other than Login/Signup pages it now works fully as a one page app, by converting most of my controllers to api's and a hefty amount of JS all logic can be done from one page. It's much more clean and User freindly (I still need practice on making things pretty though).

It was interesting learning a new Programming language, as Javascript is more of a functional programming language opposed to Ruby wich is all about objects and so many ways to make things easier.  It forces a deeper understanding of coding in general when you peal away Rubies shine (first example i can think of is how Ruby doesn't even have the traditional for loop structure and requireing an  index variable it's just done under the hood for you )  and while it doesn't make you declare primitives it at least makes you start to think about declaring types of variables even if it's only let vs const. To be fair i ended up using mostly the JQuery library because it goes back to that more 'freindly' way of programming. And more recently JS even introduced using class instead of just function and prototype as before.

It also taught me a lot more about the difference between the front and backend and how the web asks for and recieves infromation in general, the logic your browser has to execute vs the server.  

As always it was fun and a great learning experience, it's always great to feel yourself growing.
