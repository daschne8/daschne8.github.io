For my Rails project I created a simple grocery list app with the idea that it is shared between memebers of a household (if you've ever shared living space with someone you've probably heard something along the lines of "if you're going ...  can you pick up...".  Users can add items that need bought add descriptions, edit, delete, sort by tags (for example if you were at a grocery store or a hardware store).

It incorparates most things we've learned so far using bcrypt authentiction, github oauth login, namespacing, scopes,  nested routes, rendering forms, all the fun stuff.

Moving from Sinatra to Rails you can really appreciate the "magic" most of the time, but that same magic can make it harder to find where the problems lie when things go wrong.  Pathing errors being the first example to come to mind or rendering forms accross multiple pages, but once you get it down it's much more useful than repeating code constantly.  

It's a great feeling watching yourself make more and more useful applications each project iteration and once again it was a great learning experience.
