I have had an interest in programming ever since I started playing around on a Ti-83 in middle school, I remeber trying to teach myself from the manual and trying to make a very,  very basic FF style game where I couldn't even use loops (goto anyone?).  I'm a person of many interests and less focus, i was originally taking engineering courses in university but realized that if i had to choose i wanted to do programming.  Unfortunatly I ran into some personal problems and had to drop out.  In the years since then I tried off and on to teach myself programming through various sources like books, mooc's, online tutorials, followed youtube videos and the like but never with any focus in one area.  I fiddled with comp sci courses accross multiple websites, android tutorials, unity tutorials etc.. but never really got to deep as i'd switch to something else.  Recently my son was born and I realized that I needed to focus, after researching my options it seemed like Flatiron was a great choice so here i am.
